# More "Level 2" Comprehensive async Push Integration Example

This example aims to show the best practice for a more complete integration using **push** with async.

It is based on a _cover_, emulating battery operated roller blinds.

The example includes extensive comments (that should be removed if making a true integration), to guide you through what each field and property is for. It includes 2 sensors tied to the primary cover device.

It's all implemented using a _push_ model in _async_.

This example does not cover translations.
